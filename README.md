🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Git

Local Development

Clone the repository
bashgit clone <your-repo-url>
cd modulos-pricing-calculator

Create a virtual environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application
bashstreamlit run app.py

Access the app

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501
Enter the password: Modulos2025P!



☁️ Deployment on Streamlit Cloud
Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

Push your code to GitHub
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Modulos Pricing Calculator"
git push origin main


Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

Go to share.streamlit.io
Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
Click "New app"
Fill in the deployment details:

Repository: Select your GitHub repository
Branch: main
Main file path: app.py
App URL: Choose a custom URL (optional)


Click "Deploy!"
Wait for deployment (usually takes 2-5 minutes)

Step 3: Access Your Live App
Once deployed, your app will be available at a URL like:
https://your-app-name.streamlit.app
🔐 Security

Password: Modulos2025P!
The password is required on first access and stored in the session state
No sensitive data is stored permanently in the application

🎯 How It Works
Pricing Logic

Tier Selection: The app automatically selects the appropriate tier based on the number of apps
Price Calculation:

Base price from the tier's minimum
Additional cost per app beyond the minimum


Optimization Detection:

Checks if you're past the inflection point
Recommends upgrading to the next tier if more cost-effective



Key Components

find_appropriate_tier(): Determines the correct pricing tier
calculate_price(): Computes total price based on tier and app count
find_optimal_recommendation(): Analyzes for better pricing options
create_pricing_chart(): Generates interactive Plotly visualizations

🎨 UI Features

Modern Design: Gradient backgrounds and clean styling
Interactive Charts: Hover effects and dynamic data points
Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes
Alert System: Visual indicators for optimization opportunities
Metric Cards: Clean display of key pricing information

📊 Data Structure
The pricing data is structured as a list of dictionaries, each containing:
python{
    "name": "Tier Name",
    "min_apps": 10,
    "max_apps": 49,
    "base_price": 20000,
    "price_per_app": 2000,
    "inflection_point": 42.5,
    "inflection_percentage": 0.85
}
🛠️ Customization
Adding New Tiers
To add new pricing tiers, modify the PRICING_TIERS list in app.py:
pythonPRICING_TIERS.append({
    "name": "New Tier",
    "min_apps": 2000,
    "max_apps": 2999,
    "base_price": 750000,
    "price_per_app": 300,
    "inflection_point": 2500,
    "inflection_percentage": 0.83
})
Styling Changes
Modify the CSS in the st.markdown() section at the top of app.py to customize:

Colors and gradients
Card styling
Typography
Layout spacing

Password Changes
Update the password in the check_password() function:
pythonif st.session_state["password"] == "YourNewPassword":
📱 Mobile Responsiveness
The app is fully responsive and works well on:

Desktop browsers
Tablets
Mobile phones
Different screen orientations
